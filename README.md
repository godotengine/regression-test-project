## Godot regression test project
This repository contains Godot project which is tested in offical Godot repository(3.2 branch)

It aims to be complex project, which will allow to find crashes, leaks and invalid memory writes before PR is merged.

Sadly it can't find any logic errors.

For now it is really simple, but some I think that it can be improved over time.

## Contributions 
Contributions are welcome.

For now there is no requirements to format code.

New functionalities(e.g. physics checks) should be done in different folders(cleaner view to resources)

## Epilepsy Warning
Due using by project a lot of functions from each type of Node, screen may flicker, images and objects may change randomly color and size which may lead some users to health problems.
